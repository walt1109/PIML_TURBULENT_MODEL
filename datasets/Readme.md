## Training Set
- Data contains 5 feature columns that characterize turbulent flow characteristics
- Data also contain 2 target columns, low Reynolds number in a squared duct geometry and a highly separated flow of a periodic hill geometry

## Test/Validation Set
- Contain same input features and output targets as training set but in a different Reynolds number
- Will be used to validate model accuracy vs DNS output in a Barycentric triangle of Reynold Stresses
